  The Mile High presented by Carlton Dryâ€‹ at Perisher came to an end yesterday
  in spectacular fashion. The weather cleared with perfect timing and the semis
  and finals went ahead as planned. The course built by the Perisher Parks team
  was incredibly creative, with a halfpipe hit at the top and two separate rail
  and jump lines.
